# Bouffon Chat Frontend
The motivation behind this personal project is two-fold: to learn the fundamentals of React and to initiate the rewrite of the MyChat project as a web application. As I progress in the development of this project and enhance my understanding of the React ecosystem, there will be ample opportunities for improvement, and significant refactoring of key functionalities may occur.

## Phase 1 Goals
The primary objective is to replicate the core features of the MyChat project. Differences will exist as I incorporate lessons learned into the frontend's design.

* Support for 4o and 4o-mini models.
* Enable customization of conversations by model, tone (such as professional, casual, technical, etc.), instructions, and notes.
* Provide the option to create conversations using templates, which are predefined combinations of model, tone, instructions, and notes.

## Future Phase Goals
Once the core features of the MyChat project are completed, the following objectives will be considered for the next phase:

* Add support for o1 models, which require a different handling approach.
* Incorporate support for image generation using DALL-E 3.
* Implement tool commands where necessary.
* Explore the possibility of supporting text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities.
